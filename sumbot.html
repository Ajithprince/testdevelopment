    <h1>&#128526; SumBot - Free Code</h1>

    <h3>AI-Powered ChatBot with GPT-3.5 Turbo integration.</h3>

    <p>This is a project that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the business sector. It was created specifically
        for the Project and Startup Competition promoted by the International Business School Americas (IBS Americas).
        This initiative is a collaborative effort with various universities and foundations, both public and private,
        from Europe and the United States. The project reveals the activities related to the competition, which centers on
        projects and startups utilizing AI.</p>

    <h2>Why SumBot?</h2>

    <p>In today's world of information overload, we are often bombarded with lengthy texts and messages. What if there was
        a solution to this problem that didn't require programming skills? We introduce SumBot, a tool that automates the
        task of summarizing long messages for you. And the best part is, you don't need to be a programmer to use it. This
        project utilizes three essential tools: the OpenAI API, Slack (where our bot resides), and Zapier for
        integration.</p>

    <h2>How It Works:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> This is the brain of our bot. We will use the OpenAI API to harness the power of
            the GPT model, an artificial intelligence that excels at understanding and generating text.</li>
        <li><strong>Slack:</strong> This is the environment where our bot will reside. Slack is a communication platform
            that enables the creation and use of bots.</li>
        <li><strong>Zapier:</strong> This is the tool that will integrate Slack with the OpenAI API. Zapier is an automation
            tool that allows you to create workflows between different platforms.</li>
